# bridgr - Chrome Extension

bridgr is a Chrome extension that displays a different lyric by Phoebe Bridgers when you open a new tab in Google Chrome. It also displays the time and date. 
I built this project to learn more about Chrome extensions. 

## Technologies used
This project was built using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### Usage instructions
bridgr isn't currently on the Chrome Extension store yet but feel free to download it and install on your own version of Chrome. Once you've downloaded the code, click the 'extensions' icon in Chrome. Once the extensions tab has opened, click 'Load Unpacked' and select the files from your downloads file. The extension will then appear as part of your Chrome extensions.
