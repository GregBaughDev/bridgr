## Chrome Extension

bridgr is a Chrome extension that displays a random lyric by the American singer/songwriter Phoebe Bridgers.

This project was built as a personal project as I wanted to learn how to make extensions for Google Chrome.  The extension displays a lyric along with the current date and time when a new tab is opened. The lyrics are held in an array and are randomly selected and displayed on the page. This was an interesting project and after I had deployed it to my local browser I discovered strange styling issues on webpages. After further investigation I realised my CSS classes and ID's were being applied to all websites when the extension was engaged. I updated my CSS class and ID names to resolve the issue.

An example of the project can be viewed [here](https://bridgr-extension.herokuapp.com/)

## Technologies used
This project was built using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### Usage instructions
bridgr isn't currently on the Chrome Extension store but feel free to download it and install on your own version of Chrome. Once you've downloaded the code, click the 'extensions' icon in Chrome. Once the extensions tab has opened, click 'Load Unpacked' and select the files from your downloads file. The extension will then appear as part of your Chrome extensions.
